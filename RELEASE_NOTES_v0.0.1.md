# Release v0.0.1

## Initial Release

This is the very first public version of Game One, a small space shooter built with LÃ–VE2D and Lua.

The project is inspired by the CS50 Game Development course and is intended as a playground for learning and experimenting with game development. Expect frequent changes and new features as the project evolves!

### Features
- Basic gameplay: move, shoot, and avoid enemies
- Score and persistent highscore system (using a local `highscores.json` file)
- Start, pause, and game over screens

### Note
This project is a work in progress and will be expanded step by step. Feedback and ideas are always welcome!
